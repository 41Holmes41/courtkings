# FEEDBACK PROJECT 3

The kings of the court indeed! I must say the amount of data you were able to incorporate into each card is quite amazing. I really love the home screen where you can draft your team. I literally thought it was so beautiful I shed a tear. I like the direction you had with the layout over all. With this app, Its obvious that it is more of a desktop only app (at least at this moment in time). Something that could have been really cool, to save real estate, and make it more mobile friendly, would be to put the player data in a modal that opens to display the data. This method should not cause a full page refresh or open a new tab, just a new div that lays over the player card itself.

Also the accessibility could be better on the login page. Make the div holding the form have a white background or something, just so you can see the black text. Another thing that would be sweet to do is add border-shadows around the daily points cards to break the monotony and give the page more depth.

All in all this was a great app, amazing logic, very unique, with some great and novel approaches. I though you all gave really great presentations. I though it was great how you provided insight into the struggles you experienced, and how that shaped the simulator you ultimately built. I'm ready for each of you to do some amazing stuff in P4.
